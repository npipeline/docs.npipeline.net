# Aggregation

> **Prerequisites:** [Batching and Windowing](batching-and-windowing.md), [Key Concepts](../getting-started/key-concepts.md)

Aggregation groups [items](../reference/glossary.md#item) by a key and a time [window](../reference/glossary.md#tumbling-window), accumulates state per group, and emits results when windows close.

## How Aggregation Works

1. Each item is assigned a **key** (via `GetKey`) and a **window** (via the configured `WindowAssigner`)
2. Per `(key, window)` pair, an **accumulator** is maintained
3. Each item updates its accumulator via `Accumulate`
4. When a [watermark](../reference/glossary.md#watermark) closes a window, `GetResult` is called and the result is emitted downstream

Watermarks use the same event time as window assignment: the item's `ITimestamped.Timestamp`, or the configured `TimestampExtractor`, or arrival time when neither is available. Historical, replayed or back-filled data therefore aggregates correctly, because window closing follows the data's own clock and not the wall clock.

Items arriving after their window closes are dropped to prevent multiple partial results. The number of dropped items is reported by the node's `LateItemsDropped` property.

## Writing an Aggregate Node

Extend `AggregateNode<TIn, TKey, TResult>` when the accumulator type is the same as the result:

```csharp
public class SalesTotal : AggregateNode<Sale, string, SalesSummary>
{
    public SalesTotal() : base(new AggregateNodeConfiguration<Sale>(
        WindowAssigner.Tumbling(TimeSpan.FromHours(1)),
        TimestampExtractor: sale => sale.Timestamp)) { }

    public override string GetKey(Sale item) => item.Category;

    public override SalesSummary CreateAccumulator()
        => new(Count: 0, Total: 0m);

    public override SalesSummary Accumulate(SalesSummary acc, Sale item)
        => acc with { Count = acc.Count + 1, Total = acc.Total + item.Amount };
}
```

Register and connect:

```csharp
var source = builder.AddSource<SaleSource, Sale>("sales");
var aggregate = builder.AddAggregate<SalesTotal, Sale, string, SalesSummary>("totals");
var sink = builder.AddSink<ReportSink, SalesSummary>("report");

builder.Connect(source, aggregate);
builder.Connect(aggregate, sink);
```

## Advanced Aggregation

When the accumulator differs from the result (e.g., you accumulate a list but emit a computed summary), extend `AdvancedAggregateNode<TIn, TKey, TAccumulate, TResult>`:

```csharp
public class StatsAggregator
    : AdvancedAggregateNode<Measurement, string, RunningStats, StatsSummary>
{
    public StatsAggregator() : base(new AggregateNodeConfiguration<Measurement>(
        WindowAssigner.Sliding(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)),
        TimestampExtractor: m => m.Timestamp)) { }

    public override string GetKey(Measurement item) => item.SensorId;
    public override RunningStats CreateAccumulator() => new();
    public override RunningStats Accumulate(RunningStats stats, Measurement item)
        => stats.Add(item.Value);
    public override StatsSummary GetResult(RunningStats stats)
        => new(stats.Mean, stats.StdDev, stats.Count);
}
```

## Lambda-Based Aggregation

For simple cases, use the fluent grouping API:

```csharp
// Tumbling window
var totals = builder.GroupItems<Sale>()
    .ForTemporalCorrectness(
        windowSize: TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
        keySelector: sale => sale.Category,
        initialValue: () => 0m,
        accumulator: (sum, sale) => sum + sale.Amount,
        timestampExtractor: sale => sale.Timestamp);

// Sliding window
var averages = builder.GroupItems<Measurement>()
    .ForTemporalCorrectnessWithSlidingWindows(
        windowSize: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
        slide: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1),
        keySelector: m => m.SensorId,
        initialValue: () => (Sum: 0.0, Count: 0),
        accumulator: (acc, m) => (acc.Sum + m.Value, acc.Count + 1),
        timestampExtractor: m => m.Timestamp);
```

## Configuration Options

`AggregateNodeConfiguration<TIn>` controls window behavior:

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WindowAssigner` | (required) | Tumbling or sliding window strategy. Window sizes and slides must be positive |
| `TimestampExtractor` | `null` | Extracts event time from items; uses arrival time for items that are neither `ITimestamped` nor extracted |
| `MaxOutOfOrderness` | 5 minutes | How late an item can arrive and still be included. Must not be negative |

The watermark is re-evaluated on every item, so windows close as soon as the data passes them, even in a fast replay.

Windows are aligned on UTC ticks, so the same instant always lands in the same window regardless of the timestamp's UTC offset.

## Monitoring Aggregation

Call `GetMetrics()` on your aggregate node to inspect state:

```csharp
var (totalProcessed, totalClosed, maxConcurrent) = aggregateNode.GetMetrics();
int activeWindows = aggregateNode.GetActiveWindowCount();
long lateItems = aggregateNode.LateItemsDropped;
```
