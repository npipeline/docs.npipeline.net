# Resilience policies

A resilience policy decides what happens when work fails. The runtime passes it a description of the failure, and the
policy returns a `ResilienceDecision`: retry, skip, dead-letter, fail, restart the node, or continue without it.

You don't need a policy to retry, skip, or dead-letter. The node's `PipelineResilienceOptions` already describe that,
and with no policy registered, `DefaultResiliencePolicy` carries them out. Write a policy when the decision depends on
something the options can't express, such as the exception's type, the item's content, or a count you keep yourself.

## How a policy decides

A policy owns the decision, and the runtime carries it out:

- **The policy decides whether to retry.** The node's options reach the policy as advice, through `MaxRetries` and
  `CanRetry` on the failure. The runtime doesn't override the answer. The one exception is a safety ceiling: a policy
  that answers `Retry` or `RestartNode` more than 100 times for the same unit of work fails the node with an
  `InvalidOperationException` that names the policy, rather than looping forever.
- **The layer's options decide how long to wait.** A retry waits for the layer's `RetryBackoff`, such as
  `ItemRetry.Backoff`. A policy has no say in the delay. For more information, see
  [Retry strategies](retry-strategies.md).
- **Running out of retries throws `RetryExhaustedException`.** When a layer stops after at least one retry, the node
  fails with a `RetryExhaustedException` that carries the node ID, the number of attempts, and the last failure as its
  inner exception. A failure that was never retried surfaces as it was thrown.

## The IResiliencePolicy interface

The interface, in the `NPipeline.Reliability` namespace, has one method for each of the
[three layers](three-layers.md):

```csharp
public interface IResiliencePolicy
{
    // L1: an item's transform failed.
    ValueTask<ResilienceDecision> DecideItemFailureAsync<TIn>(ItemFailure<TIn> failure, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

    // L2: a transform node's output stream failed.
    ValueTask<ResilienceDecision> DecideRestartAsync(StreamFailure failure, CancellationToken cancellationToken);

    // L3: a node's execution failed.
    ValueTask<ResilienceDecision> DecideNodeFailureAsync(NodeFailure failure, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

Each method accepts only some decisions. The following table lists them:

| Method | Decisions it accepts |
| --- | --- |
| `DecideItemFailureAsync` | `Retry`, `Skip`, `DeadLetter`, `Fail` |
| `DecideRestartAsync` | `RestartNode`, `ContinueWithoutNode`, `Fail` |
| `DecideNodeFailureAsync` | `Retry`, `Fail` |

### What the policy is told

Each method receives a read-only struct that describes the failure. The following table lists the properties that
are most useful for making a decision:

| Struct | Property | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ItemFailure<TIn>` | `Item`, `Node`, `NodeId`, `Exception` | The item, the node, and what went wrong. |
| | `Attempt` | The 1-based number of the attempt that failed. |
| | `MaxRetries` | The node's `ItemRetry.MaxRetries`. |
| | `IsTransient` | Whether the node's `ItemRetry.Classifier` judged the failure transient. |
| | `IsBreakerOpen` | Whether an open [circuit breaker](circuit-breakers.md) refused the attempt, instead of the attempt being made and failing. |
| | `CanRetry` | `true` when the failure is transient, the breaker didn't refuse the attempt, and retries remain. |
| `StreamFailure` | `NodeId`, `Exception` | The node and what went wrong. |
| | `Attempt`, `MaxRestarts` | The 1-based number of the run that failed, and the node's `NodeRestart.MaxRestarts`. |
| | `Checkpoint` | The input index a restart resumes from. |
| | `Delivered` | The outputs the node has delivered so far, across all its runs. |
| | `CanRestart` | `true` when restarts remain. |
| `NodeFailure` | `Definition`, `Node`, `NodeId`, `Exception` | The node and what went wrong. |
| | `Attempt`, `MaxRetries`, `IsTransient` | As for `ItemFailure`, from the node's `NodeRetry` options. |
| | `InputConsumed` | Whether the node read input before it failed. A node that has read input isn't executed again, whatever the policy answers. |
| | `CanRetry` | `true` when the failure is transient, retries remain, and the node hasn't read input. |

Each struct also carries the `PipelineContext` as `Context`.

## The default policy

`DefaultResiliencePolicy` is the policy used when you don't register one. It follows the node's options and adds no
rules of its own:

- **Item failure:** `Retry` while `CanRetry` is `true`. Otherwise, the node's `OnItemFailure`: `Fail`, `Skip`, or
  `DeadLetter`. An attempt that an open breaker refused fails instead, even when `OnItemFailure` is `Skip` or
  `DeadLetter`, so that an outage doesn't skip or dead-letter the whole input.
- **Stream failure:** `RestartNode` while `CanRestart` is `true`, otherwise `Fail`.
- **Node failure:** `Retry` while `CanRetry` is `true`, otherwise `Fail`.

## Write a policy with ResiliencePolicyBase

To write a policy, derive from `ResiliencePolicyBase`. Each of its methods defaults to `DefaultResiliencePolicy`, so
you override only the decision you care about, and the rest follow the node's options.

The following policy dead-letters validation failures, and leaves every other failure to the node's options:

```csharp
using NPipeline.Reliability;

public sealed class DeadLetterInvalidOrders : ResiliencePolicyBase
{
    public override ValueTask<ResilienceDecision> DecideItemFailureAsync<TIn>(
        ItemFailure<TIn> failure, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return failure.Exception is ValidationException
            ? ValueTask.FromResult(ResilienceDecision.DeadLetter)
            : base.DecideItemFailureAsync(failure, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

When a policy returns `Retry`, it should still respect the failure's advice. The following policy retries rate-limit
errors more times than the node's options allow, and otherwise defers to `CanRetry`:

```csharp
public sealed class PatientWithRateLimits : ResiliencePolicyBase
{
    public override ValueTask<ResilienceDecision> DecideItemFailureAsync<TIn>(
        ItemFailure<TIn> failure, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        if (failure.Exception is HttpRequestException { StatusCode: HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests } && failure.Attempt <= 10)
            return ValueTask.FromResult(ResilienceDecision.Retry);

        return base.DecideItemFailureAsync(failure, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

A policy that returns `Retry` without reading `CanRetry`, `IsTransient`, `Attempt`, `MaxRetries`, or `IsBreakerOpen`
retries permanent failures, and retries against an open breaker. The [NP9205 analyzer](../analyzers/index.md) warns
about this.

### Decide restarts in code

`DecideRestartAsync` can choose `ContinueWithoutNode` for a node the pipeline can do without. The following policy
restarts a node after an I/O failure while restarts remain. For any other failure, it ends the node's stream and lets
the rest of the pipeline carry on, which suits an optional enrichment step:

```csharp
public sealed class RestartOrSkipEnrichment : ResiliencePolicyBase
{
    public override ValueTask<ResilienceDecision> DecideRestartAsync(
        StreamFailure failure, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        if (failure.Exception is IOException && failure.CanRestart)
            return ValueTask.FromResult(ResilienceDecision.RestartNode);

        return ValueTask.FromResult(ResilienceDecision.ContinueWithoutNode);
    }
}
```

`DecideRestartAsync` is called only for a transform whose `NodeRestart.MaxRestarts` is above zero, because only those
nodes are wrapped for restart. For more information, see [Node restart and the replay window](materialization.md).

## Register a policy

A pipeline has one policy. Register an instance, or a type that is resolved through dependency injection:

```csharp
builder.AddResiliencePolicy(new DeadLetterInvalidOrders());

// Or, resolved from the service provider:
builder.AddResiliencePolicy<DeadLetterInvalidOrders>();
```

To give one node its own policy, pass its handle:

```csharp
builder.AddResiliencePolicy(enrich, new PatientWithRateLimits());
```

The policy applies as soon as it's registered. There's nothing to enable on each node.

## The fluent policy builder

For rules that depend only on the exception type, `ResiliencePolicyBuilder`, in the `NPipeline.ErrorHandling`
namespace, builds a policy without a class:

```csharp
using NPipeline.ErrorHandling;
using NPipeline.Reliability;

// Retry timeouts up to three times, then dead-letter. Skip malformed records. Fail on anything else.
var policy = ResiliencePolicyBuilder
    .ForNode<ParseOrderTransform, string>()
    .On<TimeoutException>().Retry(maxRetries: 3)
    .On<FormatException>().Skip()
    .OnAny().Fail()
    .Build();

builder.AddResiliencePolicy(policy);
```

The builder's policies make item decisions only. Restart and node decisions follow the node's options.

### Builder methods

The following methods add rules:

| Method | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `.On<TException>()` | Matches an exception of type `TException`. |
| `.When(predicate)` | Matches an exception that satisfies `predicate`. |
| `.OnAny()` | Matches any exception. It must be the last rule. |
| `.Retry(maxRetries)` | Retries a matching failure up to `maxRetries` times, then dead-letters it. |
| `.Skip()` | Drops the item and continues. |
| `.DeadLetter()` | Sends the item to the dead-letter sink. |
| `.Fail()` | Fails the node. |
| `.RetryOn<TException>(maxRetries, exhaustedDecision)` | Retries `TException` up to `maxRetries` times, then returns `exhaustedDecision`. The default is `DeadLetter`. |
| `.RetryWhen(predicate, maxRetries, exhaustedDecision)` | As `RetryOn`, for exceptions that satisfy `predicate`. |
| `.RetryOnAny(maxRetries, exhaustedDecision)` | As `RetryOn`, for any exception. |
| `.Otherwise(decision)` | The decision when no rule matches. The default is `Fail`. |

A `Retry(n)` rule governs itself: the item is retried `n` times, even if the node's `ItemRetry.MaxRetries` is lower.
The builder's rules don't consult the classifier, so a rule like `.OnAny().Retry(3)` also retries permanent failures.
The delay between retries is still the node's `ItemRetry.Backoff`. With the HighThroughput profile, that's no delay,
so set a backoff when a builder policy retries.

### Rule order

Rules are checked in the order you add them, and the first match wins. A catch-all rule (`.OnAny()`) must be last.
Putting one before other rules makes `Build()` throw an `InvalidOperationException`:

```csharp
// Specific rules first, catch-all last.
var policy = ResiliencePolicyBuilder
    .ForNode<ParseOrderTransform, string>()
    .On<TimeoutException>().Retry(3)
    .On<FormatException>().Skip()
    .OnAny().DeadLetter()
    .Build();

// Throws InvalidOperationException: the catch-all makes the FormatException rule unreachable.
var invalid = ResiliencePolicyBuilder
    .ForNode<ParseOrderTransform, string>()
    .OnAny().Retry(3)
    .On<FormatException>().Skip()
    .Build();
```

### Node scope

A builder policy applies to one node type and one item type. A failure in any other node, or with an item of another
type, follows that node's options, as if no policy were registered.

### Shortcuts

`ResiliencePolicyBuilder` also has factory methods for the most common policies:

```csharp
// Retry every item failure up to three times, then dead-letter.
var retryAll = ResiliencePolicyBuilder.RetryAlways<ParseOrderTransform, string>(maxRetries: 3);

// Retry TimeoutException up to five times, then dead-letter. Fail on anything else.
var retryTimeouts = ResiliencePolicyBuilder.RetryOn<ParseOrderTransform, string, TimeoutException>(maxRetries: 5);

// Skip every item failure.
var skipAll = ResiliencePolicyBuilder.SkipAlways<ParseOrderTransform, string>();

// Dead-letter every item failure.
var deadLetterAll = ResiliencePolicyBuilder.DeadLetterAlways<ParseOrderTransform, string>();
```

## Dead-lettering without a sink

A policy that returns `DeadLetter` needs a dead-letter sink. If the pipeline has none, the node fails with a
`DeadLetterSinkNotConfiguredException` ([NP0424](../reference/error-codes.md)). The item is never dropped silently.
To add a sink, call `AddDeadLetterSink`. For more information, see [Dead-letter queues](dead-letter-queues.md).
